# JS Node HTML to PDF Service

This is a Node.js service that allows you to convert HTML pages to PDF documents using the `puppeteer` library.

## Installation

To use this service, you must have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run the server using the command `npm start`.
4. The server will start and listen on port 3000 by default

## Usage

To use the service, you need to make a GET request to the `http://localhost:3000/url` endpoint with the url of the html page you would like to convert in the `url` parameter. The service will return a PDF file.
